# SlugCharMap

Craft CMS allows custom character transliteration to ASCII by setting the `customAsciiCharMappings` value in `general.php`:

For instance, in Hungarian, I can set `Ã¼` to map to `u` instead of `ue` (which is a German convention). Unfortunately, this setting won't affect the slug generation mapping in the control panel, which is hardcoded in craft.js, see:

This plugin will allow the `customAsciiCharMappings` setting to work while generating slugs.

# Installation:

1. Install the plugin under `craft/plugins/slugcharmap`, so that you end up with:
    `craft/plugins/slugcharmap/SlugCharMapPlugin.php`
2. Enable the plugin in the control panel
3. Define the `customAsciiCharMappings` setting in `general.php`, see documentation for guidance:
  http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/config-settings#customAsciiCharMappings
